## Description

This dataset analyzes the 249 (1 duplicate value = 248 Mouse ID). We wanted to analyze the mice (Mouse ID) and how it reacted to the drug regimens in this dataset. 
From here, we were able to determine all the drug regimens that used on the 248 different type of mice by timepoint. The timepoint increased by 5 seconds every time, 
up to a certain time point. 

## Analysis

A total of 10 drug regimens were used and the analysis showed the following:

The 2 drugs that had the highest count total were Capomulin and Ramicane. Propriva had the lowest drug count out of all 10 drugs used on the mice.

In terms of each drug that was used on the mice, the drug where the data was closest to the mean was Ramicane. The drug that had the highest standard deviation and was furthest away from the mean and more spread out was Ketapril.

# Capumolin drug vs. mice analysis

The correlation coefficient is 0.53, stating that it has somewhat of a positive correlation between the weight of the mouse and tumor volume. This means that the heavier the mouse, the greater the tumor volume inside of them.
